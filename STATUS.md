# Open-Fugu — Status (living document)

Last updated: 2026-07-07, on `lotte.polytechnique.fr`. Phase 0, 0.5, and 1 all complete.
See `PLAN.md` for the full approved plan this implements.

## What's actually done

- [x] **Phase 0 (env setup).** Repo cloned to `/Data/alfred.ruscher/fugu`, `chmod 700`
      throughout. Venv at `/Data/.venv` (shared base image: torch 2.11.0+cu128,
      transformers 5.8.1, peft 0.19.1, trl 0.29.1) plus this project's deps
      (`bitsandbytes`, `python-chess`, `cma`, `ag2`, `a2a-sdk[http-server]==0.3.5` --
      pinned to match the AgentBeats course reference code's API; PyPI-latest `1.1.0`
      has since moved/renamed several modules, e.g. `a2a.server.apps` no longer exists
      there). Stockfish 18 (avx512 build) working via `bin/stockfish-wrapper.sh`
      (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gcc-15.1.0/lib64`, host-specific libstdc++ workaround).
      `vendor/llm_chess` re-cloned. `disk_guard.py` HF-cache baseline written.
- [x] **Autonomous-resumption mechanism**: `state.json` + `scripts/orchestrate.py` +
      `scripts/status.py` + `scripts/install_crontab.sh`. `orchestrate.py` does
      `git pull --ff-only` (picks up code from the scheduled cloud dev routine, see
      below), advances the first non-done phase by one idempotent step (launching long
      GPU work into detached `tmux` sessions), then commits+pushes `state.json` +
      `reports/` (tracked, non-gitignored small JSON summaries) and exits -- never
      blocks. A plain user crontab entry (`*/15 * * * *`, no root) runs it unattended.
      This is what makes progress survive SSH/laptop disconnects: cron and tmux are
      host daemons, independent of any agent/Claude Code session.
- [x] **Phase 0.5 (blindfold floor check) -- DONE, `reports/phase0_5_summary.json`.**
      Real, trustworthy result after fixing two engineering bugs found along the way
      (see "Bugs fixed" below): `qwen2.5-7b` 0% legal-move rate, `mistral-7b` 44%,
      `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b` 22% (3 short games each, Ruy Lopez opening, 24-ply
      cap). Verdict: `REVIEW_NEEDED` (heuristic cutoff is >50%) -- genuinely hard for
      7B instruct models to track a chess position from memory alone with zero
      board/FEN, consistent with the paper's own "Key open risk #3". Not a blocker for
      Phase 1 (wiring), but worth more prompt-engineering/larger-n before trusting
      Phase 3's SFT data collection budget.
- [x] **Phase 1 (A2A/AgentBeats wiring) -- DONE, `reports/phase1_smoke_test_result.json`
      (`passed: true`).** Per user request, inter-agent communication now goes over the
      **A2A protocol**, following **UC Berkeley RDI's AgentBeats competition**
      conventions (course material at `~/Team/AgentBeats_bench`, esp.
      `finance_economics/tutorial-agent-beats-comp` and
      `games_virtual_environments/build_what_i_mean/pragmatic_builder`, MIT license --
      vendored into `src/open_fugu/agentbeats/` with attribution comments). Built:
      - `src/open_fugu/a2a/worker_agent.py` -- each worker LLM is its own A2A **purple
        agent** (`AgentCard` + `blindfold_chess_move` skill), wrapping `LocalWorker`.
      - `src/open_fugu/a2a/orchestrator_agent.py` -- the Fugu orchestrator is *itself* a
        purple agent; the green judge only ever talks to it, never to a worker directly.
        It dispatches to a worker over A2A too (agent-to-agent, not in-process).
        Phase 1 scope: **random routing per game** (a dummy stand-in for the paper's
        learned per-query selection head, which is Phase 4 -- see the code comment in
        `orchestrator_agent.py` for why per-query routing needs a stateless-transcript
        redesign, not just a smarter routing function).
      - `src/open_fugu/a2a/chess_green_agent.py` -- **green (judge) agent**: receives an
        `EvalRequest` naming the orchestrator's URL, plays blindfold games with the real
        `chess.Board` + Stockfish scoring kept entirely server-side (never crosses the
        A2A wire -- preserves blindfold-ness exactly like the in-process harness),
        returns an `EvalResult` artifact.
      - `config/scenario_blindfold_chess_smoke.toml` + `scripts/phase1_agentbeats_smoke_test.py`,
        launched via the vendored `agentbeats.run_scenario` + `client_cli` -- matching
        the competition's own submission format almost exactly (this project could,
        with a `Dockerfile` and a registration step, likely be submitted to
        agentbeats.dev largely as-is).
      - **Verified end-to-end**: agent cards served at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`,
        JSON-RPC message round-trips, `TaskState` transitions
        (`submitted`→`working`→`completed`), `EvalResult` artifact produced. The smoke
        test's 2 games both ended in `illegal_move` (expected -- quality isn't gated
        here, Phase 0.5 already covers that) but the **pipeline itself did not crash**.

## Bugs fixed this session (worth knowing before extending the harness further)

1. **Chat-template crash on Black games.** `harness.py`'s `play_blindfold_vs_engine`
   appended two consecutive `"user"` messages (opening prompt, then the engine's first
   move) whenever the LLM played Black, with no `"assistant"` turn between them.
   Qwen's lenient template silently tolerated it (and produced garbage); Mistral's
   stricter template raised `jinja2.TemplateError` and crashed the *entire* floor-check
   run, including untested workers queued after it. Fixed by folding the engine's first
   move into the same initial user turn.
2. **Move-parsing too strict.** `extract_uci_move` required contiguous `e2e4`-style
   text; models very commonly reply `e2-e4` (hyphenated) or bare SAN (`d4`, `Nf3`).
   Fixed: the UCI regex now tolerates an optional hyphen, and a SAN fallback tries
   `board.parse_san()` (reusing python-chess's own robust parser/legality check) on
   every whitespace-split token before giving up.
3. **`HF_HOME` set after importing `transformers`** in `local_worker.py`, so the
   override never took effect -- combined with the newer `hf_xet` download backend
   ignoring `HF_HOME` regardless, worker downloads landed in `~/.cache` and blew
   through this host's 30GB NFS home quota. Fixed: env var set before the import, plus
   `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1` to fall back to plain HTTP downloads.
4. **`max_new_tokens=32` in the floor check** was too small for models that preface
   their answer with prose or (for `deepseek-r1-distill`) a reasoning chain -- responses
   were truncated before ever stating a move. Bumped to 200.

With all four fixed, Phase 0.5's numbers went from a uniform, meaningless 0% (parsing/
crash artifacts) to real per-worker variation (0% / 44% / 22%) -- worth remembering
that a "floor check found nothing works" result can itself be a bug, not a finding.

## IMPORTANT limitation of the autonomous mechanism

`cron` + `tmux` keep **already-written, already-launched** work running/retrying without
any agent session -- this is what let Phase 0.5 and Phase 1's smoke test survive
disconnects. They **cannot write new code.** Per the user's explicit ask to also use
Anthropic-managed remote scheduling: a recurring **cloud routine** (`claude.ai/code/routines`,
NOT the same thing as this host's cron) can be set up to periodically `git pull`, read
`PLAN.md`/`STATUS.md`/`state.json`/`reports/*.json`, write the next not-started phase's
code, register its `advance_phase_N` in `orchestrate.py`, and push -- **but it runs in an
isolated Anthropic cloud sandbox with zero access to this host's GPU/filesystem/tmux
sessions**, so it can only ever do the *writing*, never the *running*. This host's cron
picks up what it pushes via `git_pull_if_clean()` and executes it on the real GPU. (This
routine was discussed but not yet created as of this writing -- ask to set one up via the
`schedule` skill if wanted; it needs a `run_once`/cron schedule ≥1 hour and a green-lit
private-repo clone from the chosen cloud environment.)

## Exact next steps

1. `scripts/status.py` for a quick check; `state.json` is the source of truth.
2. **Phase 2** (formal Stockfish sanity-check script -- ad hoc already verified working
   manually multiple times this session) and **Phase 1.5-ish polish**: consider a
   prompt-engineering pass on `MOVE_FORMAT_INSTRUCTION`/few-shot examples to push
   Phase 0.5's legal-move rates up before committing Phase 3's SFT-data-collection
   GPU-hours -- current numbers (0/44/22%) are a legitimate but weak floor.
3. **Phase 1 extension**: add the other candidate workers as their own A2A agents
   (currently only `qwen2.5-7b` has been run as a purple agent; `worker_agent.py` takes
   any `CANDIDATE_WORKERS` short id via `--worker`), and update
   `orchestrator_agent.py`'s `--workers` CLI arg / the scenario TOML accordingly.
4. **Phase 4** is when per-query (not per-game) routing actually matters -- revisit
   `orchestrator_agent.py`'s "Phase 1 scope" code comment before assuming random
   per-game routing is still fine once the real selection head exists.

## Constraints to keep honoring

- One machine at a time for actual execution (no simultaneous GPU work across hosts);
  a cloud dev routine writing/pushing code is fine (see above), running GPU work in the
  cloud sandbox is not.
- `chmod 700` every created directory, `600` every created file, `umask 077` before any
  bulk creation.
- 100GB disk cap via `disk_guard.py`, warn at 80GB, refuse + ask at 100GB.
- Long GPU jobs go in `tmux -d` sessions; phase-advancement runs via plain host `cron`
  (installed, `*/15 * * * *`).
